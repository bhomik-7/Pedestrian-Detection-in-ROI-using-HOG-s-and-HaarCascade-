# Pedestrian-Detection-in-ROI-using-HOG-s-and-HaarCascade-
This Repository takes a tour of how pedestrian detection works by using only Histograms of Gradients which are local machine friendly, so can be easily run on laptops with adequate RAM and GPU. 
I used only OpenCV lobrary which is quite effective and easy to work with when it comes to Computer Vision and Image Processing tasks. Highly recommended for someone who is just beginning his/her journey in this field of CV.
I have also implemented HaarCascades but their efficiency is not so good as it cannot redact the pedestrians outside the ROI with less errors.
Finally Saving the output file of both the ROI's with bonding boxes.
other libraries used are os, json, IPython and imutils.
